Background:

In 2059, Project New Horizon embarks humanity on its most ambitious endeavor to find a new home after Earth becomes inhospitable. Upon discovering a habitable planet, the only food source found is the "lumifruit", a plant with edible potential but linked to unexplained illnesses in some who eat it. As the project's lead data scientist, you are tasked with conducting a controlled study, measuring features such as lumifruit's size, color, firmness, and luminescence against colonists' health outcomes to develop a predictive model. This model aims to distinguish safe lumifruits from harmful ones, ensuring the colony's survival. The success of this model is crucial for securing a reliable food source and promoting sustainable colony development, ensuring humanity's future.

## Data Description:

1. Acoustic Firmness Index: Measure of firmness through acoustic analysis, in arbitrary units (a.u.).
2. Atmospheric Pressure at Harvest (Pa): The atmospheric pressure in pascals at the time of harvest.
3. Bitterness Scale: Rated from 0 (not bitter) to 10 (very bitter), subject to the eater's perception.
4. Circumference (mm): Circumference of the lumifruit measured in millimeters.
5. Color Intensity (a.u.): Vibrancy of the lumifruit's color, measured in arbitrary units (a.u.).
6. Find Distance from Main Volcano (km): Distance from the main volcano to the lumifruit's growth location, in kilometers.
7. Length (mm): Length of the lumifruit measured in millimeters.
8. Luminescence Intensity (a.u.): Level of bioluminescence, in arbitrary units (a.u.).
9. Magnetic Orientation (degree): The lumifruit's orientation relative to the planet's magnetic field, in degrees.
10. Odor Index (a.u.): Measure of the lumifruit's scent intensity, in arbitrary units (a.u.).
11. Seed Count: Number of seeds found within the lumifruit.
12. Skin Thickness (mm): Thickness of the lumifruit's skin, measured in millimeters.
13. Soil pH Where Grown: Soil pH level at the lumifruit's growth location, ranging from 0 to 14.
14. Sugar Content (mg): Amount of sugar contained within the lumifruit, in milligrams.
15. Weight (mg): Weight of the lumifruit, in milligrams.
16. pH: Internal pH level of the lumifruit, on a scale from 0 to 14.
17. Edible (target): Binary indicator of edibility, with 1 for edible and 0 for inedible.
