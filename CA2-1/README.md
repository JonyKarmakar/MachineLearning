CA2

The CA2 task

In CA2 we will train several basic machine learning algorithms on a new data set using the learned best practices. That means

a. exploring the data,
b. basic preprocessing of the data,
c. splitting the data for training,
d. training several classifiers,
e. evaluating performance, and
f. visualizing results.

Note: Using scikit-learn is not used for CA2. Reason: Scikit-learn simplifies the code and it's generally a great idea to use the sklearn library instead of reinventing the wheel. However, to make sure that you understand what happens behind the high-level interface, in CA2, we want to you use only the Python standard library and basic libraries like numpy/pandas. For plotting you can use what you want. The ML classifier models are taken from the mlxtend library (see description in the Jupyter notebook).
